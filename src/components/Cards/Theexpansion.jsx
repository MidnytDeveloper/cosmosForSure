          Whole mass of the universe was contained in a single point even less
          than the size of elementary particles like quarks and leptons. Big
          Bang happened and thus the cosmic expansion started. In the beginning
          all matter and forces were combined together and as soon as the cosmic
          blast happened, these forces began to separate.
        </p>

        <p>
          First phase of the expansion is given the name of <b>Planck’s Era</b>.
          Planck Era is defined as the shortest possible time period. It was the
          time from t = 0 to t = 10<sup>-43</sup> seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was the time when all heavy masses were so small in size that
          both the main principles governing the universe, General Relativity
          and Quantum Mechanics, were working together. This period became the
          basis of the introduction of the so-called{" "}
          <b>“Theory of Everything”</b>, on which Albert Einstein and Stephen
          Hawking spent enormous effort, but success could not be achieved.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, a new theory, <b>String Theory</b>, proposes the unification
          of both theories. It predicts a new elementary particle called the
          <b> Graviton</b>, responsible for gravitational force. String theory
          is mathematically proven, but its physical significance is yet to be
          fully discovered. It proposes that even the smallest particles are
          made of one-dimensional strings whose vibration produces different
          particles and forces.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the Planck’s Era, the universe expanded to a radius of 10
          <sup>-35</sup> meters and the temperature was trillions of degrees
          Kelvin. Gravitational force separated first from the four fundamental
          forces. As the era ended, the remaining forces broke into electro-weak
          and strong nuclear forces, eventually forming the four fundamental
          forces we know today.
        </p>

        <p>
          As expansion continued, temperature dropped to billions of degrees
          Kelvin. Photons were produced, but the extreme heat caused them to
          break into matter and antimatter, which annihilated each other. Later,
          quarks came into existence. Quarks are fermions and are the building
          blocks of atoms, carrying fractional charges.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quarks and gluons formed a new state known as{" "}
          <b>Quark-Gluon Plasma</b>, where they moved freely due to extremely
          high temperatures. Matter and antimatter annihilation continued, but a
          tiny excess of matter remained — roughly one particle per billion —
          leading to the universe we see today.
        </p>

        <p>
          As temperature dropped further, quarks combined to form hadrons —
          protons and neutrons. Within just one second after the Big Bang, these
          particles survived the intense heat.
        </p>

        <p>
          The universe expanded to several light-years, and protons and neutrons
          combined to form atomic nuclei. Later, alpha particles were formed.
          Electrons also existed, but high temperature prevented them from
          bonding with nuclei.
        </p>

        <p>
          After about <b>380,000 years</b>, the universe cooled to around 3000K.
          This allowed electrons to combine with nuclei, forming the first atoms
          — primarily Hydrogen and Helium. Photons were then able to travel
          freely, making the universe transparent.
        </p>

        <p>
          This ancient light is now observed as the{" "}
          <b>Cosmic Microwave Background</b>. Hydrogen and Helium clouds later
          collapsed under gravity, forming nebulae, stars, galaxies, and
          planets.
        </p>

        <p>
          In further posts, we will discuss the <b>Stellar Cycle</b> — the life
          and death of stars.
