    As we all know, the atoms are the building block of any component. For a very
    long era of time it was believed that atom is the smallest constituent of any
    body but in 1897, an English physicist, J.J. Thompson discovered electron and
    particle physics became a new branch of science.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Finally there was a proof that atom too is made up of constituent particles
    and those particles are called elementary particles.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Later a New Zealand born British physicist Ernest Rutherford, who came to be
    known as Father of Nuclear Physics, discovered alpha particles in 1899 and
    later discovering proton in 1919, added one more along with electron in the
    family of elementary particles.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    James Chadwick, an English physicist, discovered another elementary particle
    known as neutron in 1932 which carries no charge unlike proton having positive
    charge and electron having negative charge.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-6">
    Thus the three main fundamental particles i.e. electron, proton and neutron
    came to be known as the smallest constituents of matter.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    But are there only three elementary particles which control all the actions
    of any atom and are responsible for all the basic fundamental forces? For
    school and college level, we think so and we are taught so — but that is not
    the true picture.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    All elementary particles are categorized into two parts:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-base text-gray-800 mb-6">
    <li>Fermions (Matter particles)</li>
    <li>Bosons (Force particles)</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Fermions are elementary particles which are responsible for the building
    blocks of matter. They follow Fermi–Dirac equations and Pauli’s Exclusion
    Principle.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-2">
    Fermions are of two types:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-base text-gray-800 mb-6">
    <li>Quarks</li>
    <li>Leptons</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Quarks are fundamental constituents of matter. Discovered in late 1968, they
    are of six types — up, down, top, bottom, charm and strange. They have
    fractional charges and combine to form hadrons or mesons.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Proton is made up of two up quarks and one down quark while neutron is made up
    of two down quarks and one up quark. Thus protons and neutrons are hadrons —
    hence the name “Large Hadron Collider”.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Leptons are half-integer spin elementary particles that combine with quarks to
    form a complete atom. They are of six types:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-base text-gray-800 mb-6">
    <li>Charged: Electron, Muon, Tau</li>
    <li>Neutral: Electron Neutrino, Muon Neutrino, Tau Neutrino</li>
  </ul>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Muons are elementary particles discovered in 1937 and are similar to electrons
    but with much higher mass.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-4">
    Neutrinos are fermions that interact only with weak subatomic forces and
    combine with charged leptons to form neutral leptons.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base text-gray-800 mb-6">
    It is a common misconception that protons and neutrons are basic elementary
    particles. In reality, there exists a whole family of particles whose study
    is crucial for understanding the cosmos after the Big Bang.
  </p>

  <p className="text-base font-medium text-gray-900">
    The second category of elementary particles — Bosons — will be covered in the
    next post.
