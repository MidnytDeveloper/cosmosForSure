          Gravity — not as simple as it sounds. One of the four fundamental
          forces of the universe, the weakest of all yet the most mysterious.   We
          fall, we cannot fly like birds, and everything that goes upward
          eventually returns back to Earth. This attracting force that pulls
          everything toward Earth is what we call gravity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gravity acts not only on Earth but on every planet, star, and even
          between galaxies. The revolution of planets around the Sun and stars
          around their galactic center is governed by gravity. It works, it
          shows effects, it runs the universe — but what exactly is it and how
          does it work?
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Sir Isaac Newton</b>, one of the greatest minds ever born, was the
          first to solve the mystery of gravity by categorizing it as a force.
          In July 1687, Newton published his legendary work{" "}
          <b>“Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica”</b>, revolutionizing
          science and mathematics forever.
        </p>

        <p>
          Newton proposed that gravity is a force acting between every pair of
          masses, directly proportional to the product of their masses and
          inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
          This became known as the <b>Universal Law of Gravitation</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The famous apple incident is often considered the origin of this idea,
          but history suggests it may be more myth than fact. Still, it
          symbolizes the moment when a life-changing idea struck Newton’s mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          The law was derived from the inverse square law. When published,{" "}
          <b>Robert Hooke</b> claimed that Newton had taken the idea from him.
          Whether true or not, their relationship remained strained, marking one
          of the most famous rivalries in scientific history.
        </p>

        <p>
          The proportionality constant in Newton’s equation is the{" "}
          <b>Universal Gravitational Constant (G)</b>, whose value is 6.674×10
          <sup>-11</sup> N·kg<sup>-2</sup>·m<sup>2</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The value of G was experimentally determined in 1798 by British
          scientist <b>Henry Cavendish</b> through the famous Cavendish
          experiment. Using a torsion balance, he measured the gravitational
          attraction between lead spheres in a laboratory.
        </p>

        <p>
          For nearly two centuries, Newton’s theory remained unchallenged. Then,
          in 1915, <b>Albert Einstein</b>, the father of modern physics,
          published his
          <b> General Theory of Relativity</b> after the success of Special
          Relativity. This theory completely transformed our understanding of
          gravity.
        </p>

        <p>
          According to Einstein, gravity is not a force but a consequence of the
          curvature of space-time. The universe is a four-dimensional fabric —
          three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. Massive objects
          create depressions in this fabric, causing nearby objects to move
          toward them, creating the illusion of a force.
        </p>

        <p>
          This theory was experimentally confirmed in 1919 by{" "}
          <b>Arthur Eddington</b> during a solar eclipse. He observed the
          bending of starlight passing near the Sun, validating Einstein’s
          prediction and marking the first proof of General Relativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2015, the <b>LIGO observatory</b> detected gravitational waves —
          ripples in space-time caused by massive accelerating bodies — as
          predicted by Einstein a century earlier. These waves travel at the
          speed of light and further strengthened the foundation of General
          Relativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gravity behaves differently at different scales. While negligible at
          atomic levels, it played a crucial role during the earliest phase of
          the universe known as the <b>Planck Era</b> (from t = 0 to t = 10
          <sup>-43</sup> seconds), when all fundamental forces were unified.
        </p>

        <p>
          This realization leads to the quest for a unified framework combining
          quantum mechanics and gravity — the elusive{" "}
          <b>Theory of Everything</b>.
