          Fermions and Bosons are two categories of elementary particles.
          Fermions, as discussed earlier, are the building blocks of atoms,
          while Bosons are force-carrying particles. Before discussing bosons,
          let us understand the fundamental forces in nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>There are four fundamental forces in nature:</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>1. Weak Nuclear Force:</b> These forces are responsible for
          interactions at the nuclear level, mainly radioactive decay. They play
          a crucial role in the interchange of alpha and beta particles.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>2. Strong Nuclear Force:</b> The strongest force in nature. It
          binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons and holds the
          atomic nucleus intact. Breaking this bond requires enormous energy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>3. Electromagnetic Force:</b> Responsible for electromagnetic
          radiation. It is the second strongest force and acts between charged
          particles over infinite distances. It arises from mutually
          perpendicular electric and magnetic fields.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>4. Gravitational Force:</b> The weakest force in nature but with
          the greatest range. It is always attractive. Mathematically,
          gravitational force is proportional to the product of masses of two
          bodies and inversely proportional to the square of the distance
          between them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every activity and phenomenon in the universe — from quantum to cosmic
          scales — is governed and coordinated by these forces.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Bosons</b> are particles that follow Bose–Einstein statistics and
          are responsible for all four fundamental forces. There are two types
          of bosons:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>1. Vector (Gauge) Bosons:</b> Photon, Gluon, W and Z Bosons.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>2. Scalar Boson:</b> Higgs Boson.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bosons have the unique property that multiple particles with the same
          energy can occupy the same quantum state, enabling them to act as
          force carriers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Photons</b> are the carriers of electromagnetic force. They are
          massless particles proposed by Albert Einstein and represent the
          smallest energy packets of electromagnetic radiation, including
          visible light.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Gluons</b>, discovered in 1978, are chargeless particles
          responsible for the strong nuclear force. They mediate interactions
          between quarks to form protons and neutrons.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>W and Z Bosons</b> are responsible for weak nuclear interactions,
          particularly radioactive decay. W bosons exist as W⁺ and W⁻, enabling
          transformations between particles of different charges.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Higgs Boson</b> was proposed by Peter Higgs in 1964 and discovered
          in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider. Known as the “God Particle,” it
          provides mass to W and Z bosons through the Higgs mechanism. It has a
          scalar field and no electric charge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond wave–particle duality lies <b>Quantum Field Theory</b>, which
          states that particles arise as excitations (crests) in corresponding
          fields. For example, an excitation in the electron field produces an
          electron.
        </p>

        <p>
          Similarly, the Higgs field gives mass to particles passing through it,
          giving rise to the nickname “God Particle.”
        </p>

        <p>
          There are also hypothetical particles such as the <b>Graviton</b>,
          proposed by string theory as the carrier of gravitational force, and
          the
          <b>Chronon</b>, a proposed particle associated with time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, the so-called Infinity Stones of Marvel comics may not be purely
          fictional after all — they could exist in our universe as fundamental
          particles:
          <br />
          <b>Photon, Chronon, Graviton, Electron, Quarks, Gluons.</b>
        </p>

        <p>Science is indeed a Marvel.</p>
