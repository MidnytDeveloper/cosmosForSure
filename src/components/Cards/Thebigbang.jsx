        Big Bang Theory & Origin of the Universe

        <p>
          There are many theories about the beginning and creation of the
          universe, such as the multiverse theory, computer simulation theory,
          holographic theory, and the Big Bang theory. The Big Bang theory — or
          more scientifically, the{" "}
          <b>
            Cosmic Microwave Background Lambda Cold Dark Matter Big Bang Theory
          </b>
          — is the most popular, accepted, and experimentally supported
          explanation of the universe’s origin.
        </p>

        <p>
          Approximately <b>13.8 billion years ago</b>, the entire mass of the
          universe was concentrated into a single point, even smaller than a
          millionth part of an atom — and then <b>BOOM</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Immediately after this cosmic blast, expansion began. The universe we
          see today is the result of 13.8 billion years of continuous expansion.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Big Bang proposes that the universe was created from an extremely
          dense, hot state and then expanded. Though fascinating and confusing,
          it is supported by strong observational evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jumping ahead to the year <b>1929</b>, American astronomer{" "}
          <b>Edwin Hubble</b>
          published his groundbreaking work on the recession velocities of
          galaxies and their redshift. This discovery revolutionized cosmology.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hubble showed that all galaxies are moving away from each other and
          that the farther a galaxy is, the greater its redshift (Doppler
          effect), and hence, the greater its velocity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Until then, even <b>Albert Einstein</b> believed the universe to be
          static — a belief that led to what he later called his biggest
          blunder: the cosmological constant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hubble’s observations implied that if everything is moving apart
          today, then there must have been a time when all matter was
          concentrated at a single point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even before Hubble, in <b>1927</b>, Belgian Catholic priest,
          astronomer, and physicist <b>Georges Lemaître</b> proposed the
          hypothesis of the
          <b>“cosmic egg”</b>. He predicted that the universe originated from a
          very small point and then expanded.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lemaître also developed the mathematical framework for this expansion,
          which was later formulated by Hubble as <b>Hubble’s Law</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, the foundation of the Big Bang theory was laid, and over time,
          numerous experimental observations and cosmological phenomena have
          continued to support it.
