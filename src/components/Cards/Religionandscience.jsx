        <p>
          Since the beginning of civilization, humans have searched for the
          mysteries of the universe — how the world was created, how humans were
          born, and how we ended up here. From discovering fire to inventing the
          wheel, curiosity drove humanity to build, explore, and understand
          nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stone weapons for hunting, animal skins for clothing, and later clay
          pottery — these small inventions led to the development of human
          civilization and the evolution of the human brain. The human brain is
          the most advanced among living species because it questions causes,
          searches for answers, and develops solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every physical process, stimulus response, and thought is driven by
          chemical interactions of sodium and potassium ions in the brain,
          creating electrical impulses. This extraordinary brain pushed humans
          to question reality itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among the earliest civilizations — Indus Valley, Mesopotamian,
          Egyptian, Greek, and ancient American civilizations — the Greeks were
          the most advanced in early scientific thinking. They were among the
          first to study stars, planets, and the solar system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Gazing at the sky, ancient civilizations believed celestial bodies
          were divine. These shared beliefs evolved into religions. From the
          worship of fierce gods in the Indus Valley, Sun God Ra in Egypt, Zeus
          and Poseidon in Greece, to Jupiter and Mars in Rome — nature was
          personified as divine.
        </p>

        <p>
          All ancient civilizations were polytheistic, worshipping families of
          gods that controlled natural forces. Gods interacted with humans, and
          humans worshipped them for prosperity, crops, and survival. Science
          existed under the shadow of religion, with gods believed to control
          the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, many civilizations declined, but some belief systems
          survived. Indus Valley beliefs evolved into Hinduism, while Judaism
          later gave rise to Christianity and Islam. Today, monotheistic
          religions dominate much of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          These religions describe creation through divine intervention — a
          single supreme god creating and controlling the universe. Such beliefs
          offer comfort, discouraging questions about how and why the universe
          exists. However, religion is not the enemy of science — it played a
          role in early scientific development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Religion and science are two sides of the same coin. Religion provides
          meaning and comfort, while science encourages questioning and
          discovery.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first cosmological model emerged in ancient Greece. Aristotle and
          later Ptolemy proposed a geocentric universe with Earth at the center.
          Though incorrect, it was revolutionary in recognizing cosmic motion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Greeks developed methods like parallax to estimate distances and
          discovered Earth’s spherical shape. Pythagoras, Archimedes, and others
          laid the foundation of scientific reasoning.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1543, <b>Nicolaus Copernicus</b> proposed the heliocentric model,
          placing the Sun at the center. Inspired by <b>Aristarchus of Samos</b>
          , this theory challenged the Church and reshaped cosmology.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Galileo Galilei</b> later supported heliocentrism, developed the
          first telescope, and laid the foundation of modern physics. Astronomy
          expanded as humanity began observing deeper into space.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 17th century marked the birth of modern science.{" "}
          <b>Johannes Kepler</b>
          formulated planetary motion laws, <b>Robert Hooke</b> discovered
          cells, and in 1686 <b>Sir Isaac Newton</b> published{" "}
          <b>Principia Mathematica</b>, revealing the Universal Law of
          Gravitation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Humanity now understood Earth as a planet orbiting the Sun, bound by
          gravity. Later, <b>Faraday</b> and <b>Maxwell</b> unified
          electromagnetism, and <b>Albert Einstein</b> revolutionized physics
          with Special and General Relativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quantum Mechanics revealed the subatomic world, while modern cosmology
          introduced the Big Bang theory. The quest for a unified theory
          continues through ideas like String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Science has shown us much about the universe — not everything, but
          enough to inspire awe and curiosity. Religion gives us reasons to
          live; science tells us how to live. Together, they guide humanity
          toward understanding reality.
