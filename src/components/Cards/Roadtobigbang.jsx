        <p>
          Until 1927, the idea of an expanding universe had never been
          considered. Even Albert Einstein believed the universe to be static
          when he formulated the General Theory of Relativity. To support this
          belief, he introduced the cosmological constant, Lambda (Λ), which he
          later called his greatest blunder.
        </p>

        <p>
          A truly static universe, however, is unstable. According to Newton’s
          law of gravitation, every object attracts every other object. In a
          static universe, this attraction would eventually cause all matter to
          collapse inward.
        </p>

        <p>
          To prevent such a collapse, Einstein introduced the cosmological
          constant, which acted as a repulsive force or vacuum pressure,
          maintaining balance within the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1927, Belgian astronomer and Catholic priest{" "}
          <b>Georges Lemaître</b>
          proposed that the universe began as a “cosmic egg” that later
          exploded, initiating expansion. He also provided the mathematical
          framework for an expanding universe, laying the foundation for the Big
          Bang Theory.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1929, <b>Edwin Hubble</b> observed distant galaxies and found that
          they were moving away from each other, as indicated by their red
          shift. He also concluded that the farther a galaxy is, the faster it
          moves away.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hubble derived a mathematical relation known as <b>Hubble’s Law</b>:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>V = H × D</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          where V is the recession velocity, D is the distance of the galaxy,
          and H is the Hubble constant. The Hubble constant is approximately the
          inverse of the age of the universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          These observations led scientists to conclude that all matter in the
          universe was once concentrated at a single point. The cosmic expansion
          that followed gave rise to the Big Bang Theory.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first major observational evidence of the Big Bang was the
          discovery of the <b>Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)</b> — leftover
          radiation from the early universe uniformly distributed across space.
        </p>

        <p>
          About <b>380,000 years</b> after the Big Bang, the universe cooled to
          approximately <b>3000K</b>. At this stage, electrons combined with
          nuclei, forming the first atoms and allowing photons to travel freely.
          This event made the universe transparent.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the universe expanded, this radiation lost energy and shifted into
          the microwave region of the spectrum, which we now observe as the
          Cosmic Microwave Background.
        </p>

        <p>
          The CMB was first studied theoretically in the 1940s by{" "}
          <b>Georges Gamow</b>. In 1948, <b>Robert Herman</b> calculated its
          temperature to be around
          <b> 5 Kelvin</b>, remarkably close to the currently accepted value of
          <b> 2.7K</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1964, <b>Robert Wilson</b>, while working on satellite
          communication at AT&T Labs, detected unexplained noise in antenna
          signals. After ruling out all known sources, the noise persisted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, <b>Robert Dicke</b> at Princeton University was studying
          the Cosmic Microwave Background. When the two groups compared
          findings, it became clear that the mysterious noise was actually the
          microwave background radiation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interestingly, the static noise heard during radio tuning is nothing
          but leftover radiation from the early universe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later discoveries of dark matter and the reintroduction of the
          cosmological constant in 1998 led to the most widely accepted
          cosmological model today:
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) Model</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          The concepts of Lambda and dark matter will be discussed in the next
          blog.
