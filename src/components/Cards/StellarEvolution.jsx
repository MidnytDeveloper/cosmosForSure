    There is a common saying among science nerds that we all are stardust, and
    it is quite true. Every element required for life on this habitable planet
    — carbon for our organic structure, oxygen for respiration, iron for tools,
    and even gold — is produced inside stars. So yes, we are truly “Stardust”.
  </p>

  <p>
    But how are these massive, bright, and hot celestial bodies formed? How do
    they live, and what is their fate? Let’s talk about stellar evolution — a
    process that unfolds over billions of years.
  </p>

  <p>
    From previous discussions, we know that hydrogen gas formed molecular gas
    clouds known as nebulae. These clouds consist mainly of molecular hydrogen
    and are the birthplace of every star. Under their own gravitational force,
    they collapse and form rotating spheres of gas — stars.
  </p>

  <p>
    A star may live from a few million years to trillions of years, even longer
    than the current age of the universe. The lifespan of a star depends on its
    mass. Observations show that the life of a star is inversely proportional
    to its mass — bigger stars live shorter lives, while smaller stars live
    much longer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Based on size and brightness, stars are classified into seven groups:
    O, B, A, F, G, K, and M — memorized using the phrase
    <b> “Oh, Be A Fine Girl Kiss Me”</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our Sun is a <b>G-type star</b>, yellow in color, medium-sized, and its mass
    is used as a reference unit called <b>solar mass</b>.
  </p>

  <p><b>Phases of Stellar Evolution:</b></p>

  <p>
    <b>1. Interstellar Clouds:</b> Vast clouds of molecular hydrogen, roughly
    100 light-years wide and containing millions of tons of gas. These nebulae
    are the birthplace of stars.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>2. Protostars:</b> When gravitational energy exceeds kinetic energy, the
    nebula collapses into smaller fragments. These fragments heat up, forming
    rotating balls of hot gas known as protostars.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>3. Brown Dwarfs:</b> Small protostars with about 8–10% of the Sun’s mass
    fail to initiate nuclear fusion and slowly dissipate over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>4. Main Sequence Stars:</b> When core temperatures reach trillions of
    degrees, nuclear fusion begins. Hydrogen fuses into helium, producing
    energy that balances gravity and makes the star shine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fusion occurs via two mechanisms: the <b>Proton–Proton Chain</b> (common in
    smaller stars) and the <b>CNO Cycle</b> (dominant in massive stars).
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>5. Red Dwarfs:</b> Small stars with about 0.1 solar mass. They burn fuel
    very slowly and can remain in the main sequence for trillions of years.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>6. Red Giants & Supergiants:</b> When hydrogen in the core is exhausted,
    fusion shifts to a shell, causing the star to expand. Medium stars become
    red giants, while massive stars evolve into red or blue supergiants.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>7. Planetary Nebulae:</b> Stars like the Sun shed their outer layers,
    forming glowing gas clouds while leaving behind a dense core.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>8. White Dwarfs:</b> The remaining core shines due to leftover heat and
    gradually cools over millions of years.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>9. Supernova:</b> Massive stars undergo catastrophic collapse and explode,
    scattering heavy elements across the universe — the largest explosions
    known.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>10. Neutron Stars & Black Holes:</b> Depending on mass, the collapsed
    core becomes a neutron star or a black hole. These are the final stages
    of massive stars.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will discuss neutron stars and black holes in detail in future posts.
    This is the complete journey of stars in our universe.
